    "text": "This website is brought with the background of Open Educational Resources initiative coordinated by the Leibniz-Institut für Bildungsforschung und Bildungsinformation and integrated in the official teaching and reproducible research framework of the Marburg University, Germany. It is developed at the Department of Geography under responsibility of the GISMA SPATIAL SCIENCE RESSOURCES & OGERhub.\n\n\nThe responsibility for the content rests with the instructors. Statements, opinions and/or conclusions are the ones from the instructors and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the representatives of Marburg University.\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n\nAs of 21. October 2021\n\n\n\nWith the following data protection declaration, we would like to inform you about the types of your personal data (hereinafter also referred to as “data” for short) that we process, for what purposes and to what extent. The privacy policy applies to all processing of personal data carried out by us, both in the context of the provision of our services and in particular on our websites, in mobile applications and within external online presences, such as our social media profiles (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Online Offerings”).\n\n\nThe terms used are not gender-specific.\n\n\n\nDr Christoph ReudenbachDeutschhaustr 1035037 Marburg\n\n\nEmail address: reudenbach@uni-marburg.de.\n\n\nImprint: https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/impressum.\n\n\n\nThe following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing, and refers to the data subjects.\n\n\n\n\nContent data (e.g. input in online forms).\n\n\nContact data (e.g. email, phone numbers).\n\n\nMeta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\n\nUse data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication partners.\n\n\nUsers (e.g.. Website visitors, users of online services).\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect marketing (e.g., by email or postal mail).\n\n\nContact requests and communications.\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be decisive in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.\n\n \n\n\nConsent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO) - The data subject has given his or her consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for a specific purpose or purposes.\n\n\nRegistered interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) - Processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.\n\n\n\nNational data protection regulations in Germany: In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.\n\n \n\n\nWe take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.\n\n.\n\nMeasures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to data as well as access to, entry into, disclosure of, assurance of availability of, and segregation of data concerning them. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects’ rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software as well as procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.\n\n \n\n\nThe data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with legal requirements as soon as their consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not necessary for the purpose).\n\n \n\nIf the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be limited to these purposes. That is, the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural person or legal entity.\n\n \n\nOur privacy notices may also include further information on the retention and deletion of data that takes precedence for the processing operations in question.\n\n \n\n\nCookies are text files that contain data from websites or domains visited and are stored by a browser on the user’s computer. The primary purpose of a cookie is to store information about a user during or after their visit within an online site. Stored information may include, for example, language settings on a website, login status, a shopping cart, or where a video was watched. We further include in the term cookies other technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g., when user details are stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as “user IDs”)\n\n.\n\nThe following cookie types and functions are distinguished:\n\n\n\nTemporary cookies (also: session or session cookies): Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed his browser.\n\n\nPermanent cookies: Permanent cookies remain stored even after closing the browser. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user revisits a website. Likewise, the interests of users used for range measurement or marketing purposes can be stored in such a cookie.\n\n\nFirst-party cookies: First-party cookies are set by ourselves.\n\n\nThird-party cookies (also: third-party cookies): Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.\n\n\nNecessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies: Cookies may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to store logins or other user input or for security reasons).\n\n\nStatistics, marketing and personalization cookies: Furthermore, cookies are usually also used in the context of range measurement and when the interests of a user or his behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, use of functions, etc.) on individual web pages are stored in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to show users content that matches their potential interests. This process is also referred to as “tracking”, i.e., tracking the potential interests of users. Insofar as we use cookies or “tracking” technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or in the context of obtaining consent.\n\n\n\nNotes on legal bases: On which legal basis we process your personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask you for consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for the processing of your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online offer and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.\n\n.\n\nDuration of storage: If we do not provide you with explicit information about the storage period of permanent cookies (e.g. in the context of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the storage period can be up to two years.\n\n.\n\nGeneral information on revocation and objection (opt-out):  Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to revoke any consent given or to object to the processing of your data by cookie technologies (collectively referred to as “opt-out”). You can initially declare your objection by means of your browser settings, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (whereby this may also restrict the functionality of our online offer). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared by means of a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the websites https://optout.aboutads.info and https://www.youronlinechoices.com/. In addition, you can receive further objection notices in the context of the information on the service providers and cookies used.\n\n.\n\nProcessing of cookie data on the basis of consent: We use a cookie consent management procedure, in the context of which the consent of users to the use of cookies, or the processing and providers mentioned in the cookie consent management procedure can be obtained and managed and revoked by users. Here, the declaration of consent is stored in order not to have to repeat its query and to be able to prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation. The storage can take place on the server side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie, or with the help of comparable technologies), in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device. Subject to individual information on the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of consent can be up to two years. Here, a pseudonymous user identifier is formed and stored with the time of consent, information on the scope of consent (e.g., which categories of cookies and/or service providers) as well as the browser, system and end device used.\n\n.\n\n\nTypes of data processed: Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\n\nPersons concerned: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).\n\n\nLegal basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).\n\n\n\n\nThe surveys and polls (hereinafter “surveys”) conducted by us are evaluated anonymously. Personal data is only processed insofar as this is necessary for the provision and technical implementation of the surveys (e.g. processing of the IP address to display the survey in the user’s browser or to enable a resumption of the survey with the help of a temporary cookie (session cookie)) or users have consented.\n\n.\n\nNotes on legal basis: If we ask participants for consent to process their data, this is the legal basis of the processing, otherwise the processing of participants’ data is based on our legitimate interests in conducting an objective survey.\n\n \n\n\nTypes of data processed: Contact data (e.g. email, phone numbers), content data (e.g. input in online forms), usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\n\nParticipants concerned: Communication partners.\n\n\nPurposes of processing: Contact requests and communication, direct marketing (e.g. by e-mail or postal mail).\n\n\nLegal basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to periodically review the contents of our Privacy Policy. We adapt the Privacy Policy as soon as the changes in the data processing activities we carry out make it necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes require an act of cooperation on your part (e.g. consent) or other individual notification.\n\n.\n\nWhere we provide addresses and contact information for companies and organizations in this Privacy Policy, please note that addresses may change over time and please check the information before contacting us.\n\n.\n\n\nAs a data subject, you are entitled to various rights under the GDPR, which arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 DSGVO:\n\n\n\nRight to object: You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to you which is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) DSGVO; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If the personal data concerning you is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing.\n\n\nRight of withdrawal in the case of consent: You have the right to withdraw any consent you have given at any time.\n\n\nRight of access: You have the right to request confirmation as to whether data in question is being processed and to information about this data, as well as further information and copy of the data in accordance with the legal requirements.\n\n\nRight of rectification: You have the right, in accordance with the legal requirements, to request the completion of the data concerning you or the correction of incorrect data concerning you.\n\n\nRight to erasure and restriction of processing: You have, in accordance with the law, the right to request that data concerning you be erased without undue delay, or alternatively, in accordance with the law, to request restriction of the processing of the data.\n\n\nRight to data portability: You have the right to receive data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, common and machine-readable format in accordance with the legal requirements, or to demand its transfer to another responsible party.\n\n\nComplaint to supervisory authority: Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the requirements of the GDPR.\n\n\n.\n\n\nThis section provides you with an overview of the terms used in this Privacy Policy. Many of the terms are taken from the law and defined primarily in Article 4 of the GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are primarily intended to aid understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.\n\n \n\n\nPersonal data: “Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter “data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (eg. e.g. cookie) or to one or more special characteristics that are an expression of the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\n\n\nController: The “controller” is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\n\n\nProcessing: “Processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means. The term is broad and includes virtually any handling of data, whether collecting, evaluating, storing, transmitting or deleting.\n\n\n\nCreated with free Datenschutz-Generator.de by Dr. Thomas Schwenke"

Abgaben zu den Übungen sind daher konsekutiv und zwingend fristgerecht bis zum Folgetermin im dafür vorgesehenen Bereich auf ILIAS hochzuladen. \n\n(einzeln) Eingangsreflexion (5%)\n(Gruppe) Projektplan (2-teilig: Planung Exkursion, Erarbeitung Aslo (5 %))\n(einzeln) Lerntagebuch von mindestens vier Exkursionen (10%)\n(Gruppe) Ausarbeitung eines Aslos auf Oberstufenniveau auf Poster (15 %)\n(Gruppe) Reflexion der Ergebnisse der Posterpräsentation (5 %)\n(Gruppe) Flyer auf dem der ausgearbeitete AsLo durchführbar präsentiert wird (40%)\n(einzeln) Gesamtreflexion (20%)\n\n\n\nVon der Exkursion zum außerschulische Lernort\nAls Studienleistung sollen Sie zunächst eine Exkursion anleiten, auf der Sie den Raum auf eine inhaltlich gerichtete Weise methodisch vorbereitet ergründen. Anschließend sollen Sie den von Ihnen untersuchten Raum als außerschulischen Lernort für einen Oberstufenkurs mit entsprechender Vor- und Nachbereitung konzipieren. Bitte bedenken Sie auch bei der Umsetzung für die Schule, dass es zu den Zielen von AsLo gehört, klare Bildungsziele für außerschulische Lernorte zu entwickeln. Das bedeutet Ziele, die nicht ebenso gut oder besser im Klassenzimmer erreicht werden können. Das erfordert zwingend die Fähigkeit die Lernenden im Raum angemessen zu aktivieren. Ihren AsLo sollen Sie zunächst auf einem Poster präsentieren und diskutieren. Auf der Diskussion aufbauend soll ein Flyer entworfen werden, der Lehrkräfte in die Lage versetzen, ihr AsLo-Konzept unter den gegebenen räumlichen Bedingungen möglichst reibungslos in die schulische Praxis umzusetzen. Die konkrete Umsetzung des außerschulischen Lernortes einschließlich der notwendigen Vor- und Nachbereitung ist für einen Oberstufenkurs zu konzipieren und mit unterstützenden Materialien zu versehen. Dazu sind die konkreten Lernorte in Marburg zu benennen und die Materialien an die örtlichen Gegebenheiten anzupassen. Digitale Materialien können verlinkt werden. Im Text sollte auf das Material verwiesen werden, um zu verdeutlichen, wie das Material eingesetzt werden soll.\n\n\nPoster\nAm 24.07. sollen in einer Doppelsitzung von 12-16 Uhr alle Poster präsentiert und diskutiert werden. Ihr Angebot für außerschulisches Lernen kann einen ganzen Schultag und mehrere Stationen umfassen, es soll für den Oberstufenunterricht ausgelegt sein.\nIhr Poster soll folgende Inhalte umfassen:\n\nEine fachliche Aufarbeitung des Exkursionsgegenstandes, die die Bedeutung des Themas für die Klimaresilienz Marburgs diskutiert.\nKompetenzziele, eines für jede Ebene (Sinneswahrnehmung, Container, Lagebeziehung, Konstruktion) des Kompetenzmodells https://ogerhub.github.io/aslo/unit01/unit01-05.html\nmethodsiche Entscheidungen (s. https://ogerhub.github.io/aslo/unit01/unit01-02.html), spezifische Lernorte und konkrete Aufgaben (Material kann per QR-Code zur Verfügung gestellt werden), die die Kompetenzen geziel fördern\nHinweise zur erforderlichen Vor- und Nachbereitung des Lernortes im Klassenraum.\n\nFinden Sie eine geeignete Weise in der sich Ihre Inhalte knapp und dicht darstellen lassen, vergessen Sie dabei nicht wissenschaftliche Quellen einzubinden.",

Die Integration von Code, Diagrammen und Formeln in Dokumente ist einfach. Quarto ist ideal für Hausarbeiten, da es flexible Formatierung und einfache Konvertierung zwischen verschiedenen Dateitypen bietet. Es ermöglicht auch das Einfügen von Referenzen und Zitaten. Alles in allem das derzeit beste Produktionswerkzeug für Texte und Medien. Sie können mit einem der zahlreichen Editoren arbeiten, wie Sie es z.B. von einem Office-Programm gewohnt sind. Die Vorteile sind eine derzeit unerreichte Vielfalt an Ausgabeformaten, einfachste Formatierung und unter Einbindung von z.B. Google Drive oder GitHub extrem effizientes und kollaboratives Arbeiten in der Gruppe.\n\nQuarto Einführungsvideo\nQuarto Get Started\nQuarto Markdown Basics\n\nFür eine nahtlose Nutzung ist die Verwendung eines entsprechenden Editors hilfreich. Im Folgenden werden einige Empfehlungen gegeben. Insbesondere RStudio bietet eine nahtlose Integration von Quarto. Sie können dann einfach die Vorlage am Ende dieser Seite in den Editor kopieren und auf dieser Basis Ihre AsLo erstellen.\n\n\nRStudio ist ideal für Quarto, da es eine integrierte Entwicklungsumgebung bietet, die speziell für die Arbeit mit Quarto-Dokumenten optimiert ist. Es ermöglicht die direkte Vorschau und Bearbeitung von Quarto-Dateien, was den Workflow erheblich vereinfacht. Zudem unterstützt RStudio die nahtlose Einbindung von Code und Text, wodurch die Erstellung von dynamischen und interaktiven Dokumenten erleichtert wird.\nIn RStudio sieht die Seite je nachdem ob Sie format: pdf oder format: html angeben wie folgt aus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio PDF\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternativ ist zum Beispiel GhostWriter ein einfacher und benutzerfreundlicher Offline-Markdown-Editor. Er verwendet einen doppelten Bildschirm: der linke Bildschirm ist der Editor und der rechte Bildschirm zeigt die gerenderte Datei. Er unterstützt viele verschiedene Markdown-Dialekte, z.B. GitHub, Sundown, pandoc etc..\n\n\n\nDie beiden gängigsten Browserbasierten Markdown-Editoren sind StackedIt und Dillinger. Einfach das Template anstelle des Begrüßungstextes einfügen und los gehts.\nDas schaut dann in Stackedit.io bzw. dillinger.io wie folgt aus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStackedit.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDillinger.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuf der GitHub Seite awesome-markdown-editors finden Sie eine Reihe weitrere Ressourcen rund um das Thema.",

Wo vulnerabel/ wo resilient? Wie sichtbar ist der Klimawandel am Lernort? Wie erfahrbar war die Vulnerabilität / Resilienz des Lernortes? Wie schätzen Sie die zukünftige Vulnerabilität ein? Wie besorgt sind Sie über die weitere Entwicklung der Vulnerabilität des besuchten Lernortes? Wie viel Hoffnung haben Sie, dass der Lernort in der Zukunft resilienter wird? Inwiefern sind die Adaptionen zukunftsfähig? Wie weitreichend ist die betrachtete Adaption?\nVorgehen: Kategorien von Lernorten ableiten (auf Basis der Ideenskizzen -&gt; Mittwochmorgen besprechen) Z.B.: Resilienz erfahren / Vulnerabilität erfahren / Veränderungen sehen Dann jeweils für die abgeleiteten Kategorien jeweils 1 Template (z.B. auf Ilias) erstellen und die obigen Fragen daran anpassen\nWeitere: (mögliche) Welche Kompetenzen werden durch die Exkursion gefördert? (z.B. DGfG?) Grad der Sensibilisierung: (1-10 z.B.) (umformulieren!) Exkursionsdidaktische Aspekte / Feedback auf Skala -"

Dieses Exposé skizziert eine zweistündige Vor-Ort-Einheit für Studierende, die das Bewusstsein für die Auswirkungen von Entsiegelungsmaßnahmen in Marburg schärfen und praktisches Wissen vermitteln soll.\n\n\n2. Zielsetzung\nDas Hauptziel dieser Einheit ist es, Studierenden praktische Einblicke in die positiven Effekte von Entsiegelungs- und Begrünungsprojekten auf das urbane Mikroklima und die Biodiversität zu geben. Die Studierenden sollen:\n\nVerständnis für die Notwendigkeit und die Methoden der Entsiegelung entwickeln.\nDie Bedeutung von urbaner Grünfläche für die Biodiversität und das Wohlbefinden der Stadtbevölkerung erkennen.\nFähigkeiten in der Identifiklation, Bewertung und Planung von Entsiegelungsprojekten erwerben.\n\n\n\n3. Wissenschaftliche Grundlage\nDie Einheit basiert auf Studien, die die Kühlungseffekte von Grünflächen, die Erhöhung der Albedo durch helle und durchlässige Oberflächen und die positiven Auswirkungen auf die lokale Flora und Fauna dokumentieren (Hinz und Kunz 1900). Entsiegelung trägt zur Reduzierung der Hitzeinseln bei und fördert die Grundwasserneubildung (Pat und Patachon 2000).\n\n\n4. Didaktische & methodische Analyse\nAus den wissenschaftliches Grundlagen zu den Effekten von Entsieglungs- und Begrünungsprojekten auf das urbane Mikroklima geht hervor, dass folgende Prozesse entscheidend sind. […] Damit diese Prozesse den Schüler/innen zugänglich werden, sollen sie am Lernort durch praktische Tätigkeit […].\n \n\n\n5. Vorbereitung außerschulischer Lernort\nVorbereitend auf die praktische Übung im Gelände, sollen die Schüler/innen den Einfluss von Entsiegelungsmaßnahmen auf das Mikroklima und die Biodiversität theoretisch erfassen. Zentral ist dabei, dass […].\nDie Schüler/innen sollen auch das methodische Vorgehen vorbereiten, indem […] (siehe Material M1).\n\n\n6. Gestaltung des außerschulishcen Lernortes\nDie Schüler/innen werden vor Ort Beispiele für erfolgreiche Entsiegelungsprojekte in Marburg untersuchen, wie die Gestaltung um die Elisabethkirche […]. Aktivitäten umfassen:\n\nPraktische Übungen zur Bewertung des Mikroklimas und der Biodiversität vor und nach der Entsiegelung. […]\n\n\n\n7. Nachbereitung des außerschulischen Lernortes\nDie Ergebnisse des Lernortes sollen schließlich ausgewertet werden. […] Daran anschließend soll der Lernort hinsichtlich seiner Anpassung an den Klimawandel bewertet werden. Dazu […] (siehe Material M4).\n\n\n8. Lernerfolg der Teilnehmenden\nDer Erfolg der Einheit wird durch die aktive Teilnahme an Diskussionen, das Verständnis der thematischen Inhalte und die Fähigkeit, eigene Lösungsansätze für Entsiegelungsmaßnahmen zu entwickeln, gemessen. Es soll ein Wissenszuwachs in […] erreicht werden.\n\n\nLiteratur\n\nIPCC 2050, Report on a past that was a failure\nHinz und Kunz 1900.

    "text": "Modelle und Konzepte für ausserschulische Lernorte\nDidaktische Ansätze für außerschulische Lernorte werden in der wissenschaftlichen Literatur breit diskutiert, wobei die Studien und Publikationen eine große konzeptionelle und begriffliche Vielfalt aufweisen (Baar und Schönknecht 2018). Nahezu alle Bildungsbereiche haben relevante fachliche didaktische Modelle und Methoden adaptiert. Jedoch fehlen spezifische didaktische Modelle für außerschulisches Lernen weitgehend (Baar und Schönknecht 2018).\n\nDas Kreismodell nach Freericks\nFreericks hebt vier Hauptthesen in der Didaktik außerschulischer Lernorte hervor: die Transformation traditioneller didaktischer Ansätze, die Beibehaltung konventioneller Lernmethoden, die Einzigartigkeit außerschulischer Lernformen und die Unterscheidbarkeit dieser Lernumgebungen (Freericks, Wulf, und Brinkmann 2017; Freericks und Brinkmann 2020). Das bekannte didaktisches Dreieck bestehend aus Lehrenden, Lernenden und Lerninhalten, erhält in der außerschulischen Didaktik eine dynamische Komponente, wobei vor allem der Lernort und die dort verbrachte Zeit als modifizierende Faktoren hinzukommen. Außerschulische Lernorte gehen über den traditionellen Schulunterricht hinaus und zeichnen sich nach Freericks durch drei Hauptelemente aus (Freericks, Wulf, und Brinkmann 2017):\nFunktional: Außerschulische Lernorte dienen nicht nur bildungspolitischen Zwecken, sondern beinhalten auch Aspekte wie Produktions-, Forschungs- und Medienkompetenz. Sie ermöglichen die praktische Anwendung von Wissen und Fertigkeiten in unterschiedlichen Kontexten.\nStrukturell: Diese Lernorte werden in ihrer räumlichen und zeitlichen Dimension betrachtet. Sie zeichnen sich durch eine hohe Flexibilität in der Nutzung aus, was sie von schulischen Lernumgebungen unterscheidet. Die Einbettung in den Lehrplan kann dazu beitragen, das Interesse der Lernenden zu wecken und Wissen zu vertiefen.\nSpezifisch: Die spezifischen didaktischen Mittel, die an diesen Orten eingesetzt werden, wie z.B. Workshops, Lernstationen, Expertenführungen oder forschendes Lernen, gestalten die Lernerfahrung und helfen, die Lernziele auf originäre Weise zu erreichen.\nDiese Strukturierung kann gut genutzt werden, um die komplexen Wirkungszusammenhänge konkreter Lernorte zu visualisieren. Nachfolge Abbildung zeigt exemplarisch eine solches Kreisdiagramm für den Ausserschulischen Lernort Urban Gardening.\n\n\n\nKreismodell Urban Gardening verändert nach (Freericks, Wulf, und Brinkmann 2017)\n\n\n\nDie Feindimensionen\nNeben den allgemeinen didaktischen Kriterien sollten außerschulische Lernorte auch anhand detaillierterer Feindimensionen der Wissensvermittlung geplant und bewertet werden. Diese beleuchten speziell die Art der Wissensvermittlung in Bezug auf die Rolle des Lernenden sowie die Einflüsse des Raumes. Um die Variabilität dieser Einflüsse an verschiedenen Lernorten darzustellen, ist eine Darstellung mit Skalen sinnvoll. Diese Skalen helfen zu erfassen, wie stark oder auf welche Weise diese Dimensionen zur Wissensvermittlung an verschiedenen Lernorten beitragen. Die folgende Abbildung zeigt exemplarisch eine solche Darstellung amn einer Schar von Skalenstrahlen.\n\n\n\nDidaktische Feindimenstionen (Freericks, Wulf, und Brinkmann 2017, 18)\n\n\nTechnik/Grad der Medialisierung:.\nAußerschulische Lernorte nutzen häufig Medien wie Videobeiträge, Hörstationen und Touchscreens, um Inhalte anschaulich und abwechslungsreich zu vermitteln. Es besteht eine klassische Sender-Empfänger-Beziehung, wobei die Interaktion variieren kann. Die Medien können unidirektional oder bidirektional genutzt werden, je nachdem, ob der Lernende selbst aktiv und individuell mit den Medien interagiert.\nGrad der Selbststeuerung:.\nNicht alle außerschulischen Lernarrangements ermöglichen ein hohes Maß an Selbststeuerung durch den Lernenden. Während einige Arrangements, wie z.B. Vorlesungen, stark vorgegeben sind, ermöglichen andere, wie z.B. frei begehbare Raumarrangements, eine aktive und selbstbestimmte Nutzung der Lernangebote.\nBeteiligung der Lernenden:.\nIn manchen außerschulischen Kontexten erfolgt die Aneignung von Inhalten eher rezeptiv, wie z.B. bei Informationstafeln oder Videos. Andere Exponate erfordern eine aktive Beteiligung des Lernenden, um den Lerninhalt zu aktivieren, z.B. durch die Manipulation von Schleusen oder Dämmen in einem Exponat über Wasserkraft.\nArt der Wissensvermittlung:.\nDie Wissensvermittlung kann stark vorstrukturiert oder offen gestaltet werden. Bei offenen Formen können sich die Lernenden die Inhalte spielerisch selbst erarbeiten, während strukturierte Wege vorgegeben werden. Ein Beispiel für eine offene Form ist eine interaktive Medienperformance, bei der die Inhalte durch die aktive Beteiligung des Lernenden mit einem Tablet gestaltet werden.\nEmotionale Beteiligung:.\nDie emotionale Beteiligung variiert stark und ist oft eng mit dem Lerninhalt und der räumlichen Nähe verbunden. Sie kann von Unterhaltung und Spaß bis hin zu persönlicher Betroffenheit reichen, wie die Unterschiede zwischen einem Freizeitpark und einer KZ-Gedenkstätte zeigen.\nGestaltung/Ästhetik: Ästhetik spielt eine wichtige Rolle bei der Vermittlung von Inhalten in außerschulischen Lernkontexten. Sie reicht von funktional-naturalistischem Design bis hin zu narrativem Design, das einen ästhetischen Erzählrahmen schafft und Lerninhalte in ein ganzheitliches Raumdesign integriert, wie im Universum Bremen zu sehen (Freericks, Wulf, und Brinkmann 2017, 19f.).",

Ausgehend von der Prämisse, dass außerschulisches Lernen einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Entwicklung neuer Kompetenzen leisten kann, konzentrieren sie sich auf praxisorientierte Ansätze und die Nutzung realer Lebenssituationen, um den Lernprozess anschaulicher zu gestalten. Neben anderen Ansätzen nehmen das forschende Lernen, das Entdecken und Beobachten sowie das selbstständige Arbeiten außerhalb des Unterrichts einen besonderen Stellenwert ein. In der folgenden Abbildung ordnen sie die gängigen methodischen Lernformen den drei methodischen Ebenen Mikro-, Meso- und Makromethodik (vgl. Meyer 2004) des außerschulischen Lernens zu.\n\n\n\nBeispielhafte methodische Möglichkeiten des außerschulischen Lernens (Sauerborn und Brühne 2020)\n\n\nDidaktische Konzepte für außerschulische Lernorte, insbesondere in Bezug auf Klimaresilienz, sollten darauf abzielen, Schüler:innen für Umweltfragen zu sensibilisieren und sie zu motivieren, eigenständig Veränderungen in ihren Lebenssituationen herbeizuführen. Die Lehrkräfte müssen daher den Unterricht nach Kriterien gestalten, die sicherstellen, dass die Situationen für die Schüler:innen aktuell und relevant sind, in ihren subkulturellen Lebenswelten real existieren und beeinflussbar sind. Der Lernprozess entsteht durch das Zusammenspiel von Situationsbezug und Handlungsorientierung, wobei die Schüler ihre eigene Betroffenheit nur dann wirklich erfahren, wenn die Lerninhalte eng mit ihrer Lebenswelt verknüpft sind. Insbesondere Umweltbildung sollte fächerübergreifend erfolgen, um die Perspektiven verschiedener Disziplinen zu integrieren und zu verdeutlichen, dass Umweltthemen alle Lebensbereiche betreffen. Hier ist das Fach Geographie hervorragend aufgestellt.\nDie Bedeutung außerschulischer Lernorte ist deshalb so groß, weil rein theoretisches Wissen nicht ausreicht, um Schüler zu aktivem Handeln zu bewegen. Außerschulische Lernorte bieten unverzichtbare praktische Erfahrungen. Diese Bildung sollte kritisch sein, die Schüler ermutigen, eigene Ideen einzubringen und die prinzipielle Wandelbarkeit und Subjektivität wissenschaftlicher Aussagen berücksichtigen und transparent machen.\n\nPlanungsdreischritt\nDie methodische Planung des außerschulischen Lernens kann durch den sogenannten Planungsdreischritt vorgenommen werden, der auf den ersten Blick banal erscheint, sich aber als effektiv erweist (Burk und Claussen 1980) zu orientieren.\n Nachfolgend ein exemplarisches dreistufiges Planungsschema an einem außerschulischen Lernort in einer Universitätskleinstadt mit Schwerpunkt auf der handlungsorientierten Nachbereitungsphase des Urban-Gardening-Projekts.:\n\n1. Vorbereitung\nZiele festlegen:. Die Schülerinnen und Schüler sollen die vielfältigen Aspekte des Urban Gardening, einschließlich seiner Vorteile und Herausforderungen, sowie seine Rolle für die Klimaresilienz und Nachhaltigkeit von Städten verstehen.\nEinführung:. - Die Lehrkraft führt in die grundlegenden Konzepte des Urban Gardening ein, diskutiert positive Effekte wie Biodiversität und städtisches Mikroklima sowie Herausforderungen wie Ressourcenmanagement und Gentrifizierung. - Darstellung der Funktionalität von Urban Gardening in Bezug auf soziale, ästhetische, produktive und ökologische Aspekte.\nPodiumsdiskussion:. - Expertinnen und Experten aus Stadtplanung, Umweltwissenschaften und Sozialarbeit diskutieren über Urban Gardening mit Fokus auf Klimaresilienz und urbane Grünachsen.\nRechercheaufgaben:. - Studenten recherchieren erfolgreiche Urban Gardening Projekte und deren Ansätze zur Lösung spezifischer urbaner Probleme, um Best Practices und innovative Ideen zu sammeln.\n\n\n2. Lernort - Urban Gardening Projekt in Marburg\nBeobachtung und kritische Analyse:. - Die Schüler beobachten und analysieren die angewandten Praktiken des Urban Gardening, einschließlich der Pflanzenauswahl, des Wassermanagements und der integrativen Designansätze. - Teilnahme an einer Führung, die sich speziell auf die Herausforderungen und Lösungen des Projekts konzentriert.\nPraktische Aktivitäten:. - Die Schülerinnen und Schüler entwickeln alternative Nutzungskonzepte für den Garten, um den Raum optimal zu nutzen und verschiedene Bedürfnisse zu integrieren. - Die Schülerinnen und Schüler befragen Anwohnerinnen und Anwohner zu ihrer Akzeptanz und Beteiligung.\n\n\n3. Nachbereitung\nAnalyse und Anwendung des Gelernten:. - Die Schüler entwickeln eigenständige Projekte, die auf den gewonnenen Erkenntnissen basieren, um den Garten zu verbessern oder neue urbane Gartenprojekte zu planen. - Interaktive Präsentationen ihrer Projekte durch Führungen, bei denen sie ihre Vorschläge und Veränderungen im realen Gartenkontext demonstrieren.\nBeteiligung der Gemeinschaft:. - Durchführung von Planungsworkshops, in denen die Schüler ihre Ideen und Projekte der lokalen Gemeinschaft vorstellen und aktiv Feedback einholen. - Übernahme von Patenschaften für Teile des Gartens, um langfristige Verantwortung und kontinuierliches Engagement zu fördern.\nFörderung von Reflexion und kritischem Denken:. - Schüler führen Reflexionstagebücher und nehmen an Debatten über kritische Themen des urbanen Gärtnerns teil. - Erstellung von digitalen Portfolios oder Blogs, um den Projektfortschritt zu dokumentieren und die Ergebnisse einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen.\nDieser umfassende Ansatz ermöglicht es den Schülern, sich aktiv an der Gestaltung und Verbesserung ihrer Lernumgebung zu beteiligen und gleichzeitig einen tieferen Einblick in die komplexen Zusammenhänge urbaner Ökosysteme und deren Management zu gewinnen.\n\n\n\nGranulare Ausplanung\nMehrstufige und granulare Modelle des außerschulischen Lernprozesses können in der Praxis zwar als schwer umsetzbar und für den Lernprozess als problematisch angesehen werden. Dennoch ist es in vielen Situationen hilfreich, die Grobplanung nach Burk und Claussen (1980) in eine Feinplanung zu überführen.\nDie folgende Übersicht zeigt beispielhaft und schematisch, welche Arten der Handlungsorientierung an diesen außerschulischen Lernorten vermittelt werden sollten. Vor allem die Bedeutung der Vor- und Nachbereitung wird noch einmal deutlich.\n\n\n\nBeispielhafte methodische Möglichkeiten des außerschulischen Lernens verändert nach Sauerborn und Brühne (2020), 91",

    "text": "Resumè\nIn der Praxis des außerschulischen Lernens verliert das ursprüngliche pädagogische Konzept oft seine Struktur und verliert sich in einem ideologisch gefärbten Meinungsgewirr, das der Schule, dem Unterricht und vor allem den Kindern und Jugendlichen wenig hilft. Lehrerinnen und Lehramtsanwärterinnen empfinden die ständige Diskussion in der Bildungsforschung oft als ermüdend und nicht zielführend. Dennoch wird außerschulisches Lernen von Bildungsexpertinnen als wirksame Methode anerkannt, die aktivierendes und handlungsorientiertes Lernen unterstützt. Es erscheint notwendig, das außerschulische Lernen wiederzubeleben und als festen Bestandteil der Bildungspraxis zu etablieren, um den Schülerinnen authentische Erfahrungen und eine lebensweltlich bereicherte Bildung zu ermöglichen. Gerade die Kombination von erfahrungsbasiertem und systematischem Lernen bietet die Möglichkeit, eine zukunftsorientierte und qualitativ hochwertige Bildung zu gewährleisten.",

Skalen und Prozesse sind zwei grundlegende Konzepte in der Ökologie, die verwendet werden, um ökologische Muster und Dynamik zu verstehen.\nSkalen in der Ökologie beziehen sich auf die räumlichen und zeitlichen Dimensionen ökologischer Phänomene. Ökologische Phänomene treten in verschiedenen Maßstäben auf, die von einzelnen Organismen bis zu ganzen Ökosystemen und von Sekunden bis zu Jahrtausenden reichen. Das Verständnis der geeigneten Skala ist entscheidend für das Verständnis der ökologischen Prozesse, die innerhalb dieser Skala ablaufen. Die Wahl eines geeigneten Maßstabs beeinflusst auch die Genauigkeit und Präzision ökologischer Daten und die Interpretation ökologischer Muster.\nProzesse in der Ökologie beziehen sich auf die biologischen und physikalischen Mechanismen, die ökologischen Phänomenen zugrunde liegen. Ökologische Prozesse treten in verschiedenen Maßstäben auf, die von der molekularen Ebene bis zur Landschaftsebene reichen. Zu den ökologischen Prozessen gehören biotische Interaktionen wie Konkurrenz, Räuber und Gegenseitigkeit sowie abiotische Interaktionen wie Klima, Nährstoffkreislauf und Störungen. Das Verständnis der zugrundeliegenden Prozesse ist unerlässlich für die Vorhersage, wie ökologische Systeme auf veränderte Bedingungen reagieren werden, und für die Entwicklung wirksamer Erhaltungs- und Bewirtschaftungsstrategien.\nInsgesamt sind Größenordnungen und Prozesse wesentliche Konzepte in der Ökologie, die dazu dienen, die komplexen Wechselwirkungen zwischen Organismen und ihrer Umwelt zu verstehen."

Eine der bekanntesten ist das Konzept des zeitlichen Maßstabs, das von dem Geographen David Harvey entwickelt wurde. Nach Harvey bezieht sich der zeitliche Maßstab auf die Länge der Zeit, über die ein Phänomen beobachtet werden kann, und er ist ein wichtiger Faktor für das Verständnis der räumlichen Beziehungen und Muster, die in einem bestimmten geografischen Kontext bestehen. Darüber hinaus argumentiert Harvey, dass der zeitliche Maßstab, in dem Daten erhoben und analysiert werden, einen erheblichen Einfluss auf die Schlussfolgerungen haben kann, die aus den Daten gezogen werden können.\nEine weitere Theorie, die sich auf die Auswirkungen der Zeit auf den Maßstab bezieht, ist das von dem Geographen David Harvey und anderen entwickelte Konzept der Zeit-Raum-Kompression. Diese Theorie besagt, dass Fortschritte in Technologie und Kommunikation zu einer Kompression von Zeit und Raum geführt haben, wodurch die Welt kleiner und vernetzter erscheint. Infolgedessen können geografische Phänomene von Faktoren beeinflusst werden, die in verschiedenen räumlichen und zeitlichen Maßstäben existieren, und es ist wichtig, diese Faktoren bei der Analyse und Interpretation von geografischen Daten zu berücksichtigen.\nInsgesamt verdeutlichen die Theorien zu den Auswirkungen der Zeit auf den Maßstab in der Geographie die komplexen und dynamischen Beziehungen zwischen räumlichen und zeitlichen Phänomenen und die Bedeutung der Berücksichtigung dieser Beziehungen in geographischen Analysen (Harvey 1996)."

    "text": "4.2 Schlussfolgerungen\nZeit-Raum-Kompression ist ein Konzept, das von mehreren Geographen entwickelt und ausgearbeitet wurde, darunter David Harvey, Doreen Massey und Henri Lefebvre. Im Kern bezieht sich die Zeit-Raum-Kompression auf die Idee, dass Fortschritte in der Transport- und Kommunikationstechnologie ein Gefühl des “Schrumpfens” in Bezug auf die Zeit und den Raum geschaffen haben, die für soziale und wirtschaftliche Interaktionen erforderlich sind.\nDie Zeit-Raum-Kompression manifestiert sich unter anderem in der zunehmenden Geschwindigkeit und Leichtigkeit von Transport und Kommunikation. Flugreisen, Hochgeschwindigkeitszüge und das Internet haben es beispielsweise möglich gemacht, Waren, Menschen und Informationen in relativ kurzer Zeit über große Entfernungen zu transportieren. Dies hat zu einer Verwischung der traditionellen räumlichen Grenzen und zur Entstehung globaler Netzwerke für Austausch und Interaktion geführt.\nDie Verdichtung von Zeit und Raum ist jedoch kein neutraler oder einheitlicher Prozess, und seine Auswirkungen werden von verschiedenen Menschen und an verschiedenen Orten unterschiedlich empfunden. So kann die zunehmende Geschwindigkeit des globalen Handels einigen Menschen und Gemeinschaften zugute kommen, während sie anderen schadet, und die Intensivierung globaler Netzwerke kann bei einigen Menschen zu einem Gefühl der Dislokation oder Desorientierung führen.\nInsgesamt ist die Zeit-Raum-Kompression ein wichtiges Konzept in der Geografie, weil es hilft zu erklären, wie die räumlichen Beziehungen und Muster, die in einem bestimmten geografischen Kontext bestehen, durch technologischen Wandel und Globalisierung geformt und verändert werden."
